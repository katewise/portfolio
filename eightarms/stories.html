            This whole project began with a simple statement from my dad over
            the summer before my final year at university.
            <br />
            “When you go into your interview for a new job after uni, make sure
            you tell the interviewer you are infertile so he doesn’t use it
            against you that you might have children soon.”
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
          <h2>
            “I a koe ka kōkiri atu ki tō uiui mō te mahi a muri i tō nohonga ki
            te whare wānanga, me matāra tō whakamōhio atu ki te kaiuiui, e puku
            pā ana koe. Kei kore te tangata e huri, te patu i a koe mā te kupu,
            ainī pea ka whakawhānau pēpī tonu.”
          </h2>

            For his job he manages staff and conducts interviews for new hires
            too. This was his advice to me as a 32 year old married female with
            no children. Pretty grim stuff because I agreed wholeheartedly and
            even evaded answering the question of my family’s future plans in
            interviews I participated in after that conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is unfortunately just something most working women have faced.
            Whilst conducting research for the project I had several wahine tell
            me they believed they didn’t get the job based on one statement in
            their interviews - “Yes I have tamariki - children.” So why don’t
            men get asked these things? - Because children don’t often affect a
            male’s ability to work. Mostly, parenting falls on the mother,
            whether that is carrying the child or picking them up from school
            when they are sick. This is often due to them being the lower income
            earner - but that is a catch for another day.
          </p>
          <p>
            So how could I take this conversation between my dad and I and turn
            it into a positive? Originally I conducted interviews and jotted
            down stories from other women with the intent to bring us all
            together through shared trauma - but that wasn’t helping the issue.
            The issue, as was concluded based on my findings, was that only one
            woman out of thirty had faced unequal behavior from another woman.
            The real problem here - was men.

            Men were the ones causing these cultural differences in workplaces
            and piling up the workload of females until they needed eight arms
            to get all their extra work done. From event planning to workplace
            dishes, women accept extra work just because of their gender and in
            2023, it’s time to change the way we think.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eightarms was created to bridge the gap between your average kiwi
            bloke and the working wahine. We need all the help we can get and it
            starts with men recognising their actions and accepting change as a
            positive in their lives instead of a chore.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="quote">
          <h2>
            I whakatūria a Eight Arms hei arawhiti I runga I te whāruarua I
            waenganui I te tāhake kiwi kei tētahi taha me te wahine e mahi ana
            kei tāwāhi. Ka tino hiahia āwhina mātou, ā, ka tīmata taua āwhina
            ina ka mōhiohio te tāne ki ana ake mahi, ka whakaae hoki: he mea pai
            te panonitanga mā tōna oranga, ehara i te whakarīrā.

            So how do we get their attention? Is it cliche to think that the
            average kiwi bloke likes fishing - yes? But so what? While
            researching I discovered this to be the most common hobby between
            men aged 30-40 and so the hoodwinking commenced.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please don’t be mad that you were deceived with fishing themed puns
            and quirky illustrations - we are crying out for change and only you
            can make that happen. So cast your line out and reel in your biggest
            catch yet - equality for women.
