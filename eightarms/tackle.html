          <p>
            There are a few common themes when it comes to inequality, and this
            one is BIG. Women aren’t being heard. In a meeting with ten people,
            its takes eight of them to be female before their voices are heard
            as much as the mens.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Whether that’s in a meeting or serving customers. There seems to be
            a common denominator in all of this: men don’t realise how much
            their voices dominate a conversation. So, here’s our tip: sit back,
            relax, and ask for your female colleague’s opinion. Her ideas may
            surpass Steve’s from accounting, he is unbelievably boring after
            all.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Often, when a woman voices an idea, it isn’t heard until a man says
            it. So, here’s another tip - reiterate what she said to the whole
            group and give her credit. You would not believe how much more your
            office will retain hard-working femmes just by following this one
            single tip.

          <p>
            There’s a time and place for shit yarns with the boys and we believe
            spending a day out on the boat talking shit and sinking piss is
            completely inevitable. What isn’t ok is doing it in the office, or
            even the lunchroom. We get it, there’s plenty of fish in the sea but
            the whole office doesn’t need to hear about it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            So here’s our next tip - keep the sharns for Saturdays with the
            boys. We’re not cancelling the boys club; we’re just canceling it
            between the hours of 9-5 Monday to Friday - does that sound
            reasonable?

            As a man, have you ever been asked whether or not you plan to have

            have been. So please, it’s illegal not to hire someone based on
            their maternal requirements so let’s cut that line nice and quick.

            Is it ok to ask about their family then? This one is tricky and we
            suggest not to. If they want to tell a virtual stranger about their
            beautiful newborn then they will. However it can be seen as fishing
            on your behalf if you ask.

            Ok so we need another woman in the office to even out the men and do
            the event planning cause we suck at it. Well, did you state this in
            the interview? Don’t reel them in with tempting careers only to snag
            them in the rocks event planning. Be transparent.

            Fish on! Great, you’ve hired a woman! ..Now how do you keep her on
            the line? Losing a jig is rough but losing someone due to ‘cultural
